## Intro
* This API was developed by Griffin Atkinson, April 2021, in order to communicate with the React Noodlewall prototype, as part of a coop placement for FRMH at Confederation College.
* This API can be used both locally and remotely, although to use locally, small manual modifications need to be made to files, and alternate database setup procedure must be followed, details are outlined clearly throughout setup process.
* Currently the remote repository is hosted on my personal site "gatkinson.site", and will likely be unavailable shortly after the coop placement ends

# Description
* This API's functionality is to be used by a frontend prototype to store user accounts and event objects, as well as corresponding images, and interact with them. 
* It contains the functionality for the frontend to create/read/update/delete user profiles and the user's events

# Getting Started
* 1 - Setup database -> See Database Setup
* 2 - Modify files if using repository locally.
	Local vs Remote repository, when using api locally,
    	-> change the database connection info on the config/database.php from the remote repository connection info, to the local repository connection info supplied
    	-> change and the addresses in event/uploadEventImage.php, and user/uploadUserIcon.php from the remote repository address, to the local repository address supplied
* 3 - Make calls to the endpoints -> see API_Call_Examples.txt

# Database Setup
*   config/database.php -> contains database connection details and credentials (see file to uncomment/comment details when connecting to local vs remote repositories)
*   db_scripts/ folder contains scripts with sql queries that when used on database will create the database "noodlewall_db" and the tables "events, users"(create_db.sql), and populate it with event and user data 
*   If using remote repository -> (populate_db.sql)
*   If using local repository -> (LOCAL_populate_db.sql)
